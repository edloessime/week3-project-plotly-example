## Store Sales and Discount Dollar Analysis

This involves reviewing the total store sales and the discount dollars applied to customers.

```{r}

Using plotly, compare the sales, discount dollars awarded across the various stores, highlighting the number of transactions using bubble size.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(storedata, x = ~sales, y = ~discountDollars, type = "scatter", color = ~factor(storeNumber), size = ~numTransactions)
```
